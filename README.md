mate-calc GTK3 version

1. Introduction.
----------------

This is mate-calc, a fork of gnome-calc, the calculator application that was
previously in the OpenWindows Deskset of the Solaris 8 operating system.

It incorporates a multiple precision arithmetic packages based on the work
of Professor Richard Brent, who has also kindly given me permission to make
it available.

There is a single graphics driver for Gtk3 included with this release.


2. Getting started.
-------------------

The manual pages also describe how to use mate-calc in detail.
